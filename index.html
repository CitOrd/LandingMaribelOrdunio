    <p class="izquierda">
        Some of the things I enjoy doing the most is reading books, manga or scientific magazines. 
        Also cooking, is something I'm passionate about, more so when I make food for people I love very much.
        In my spare time I want to de-stress video game play is something I do frequently and I like it too much.
        Another thing I like to do is exercise, I do it daily in the mornings. Finally, I like it too. 
        informing me about things related to the career, about technology as well as topics related to organization,
        productivity, philosophy, among more.

<h1>Favorite movies</h1>
<p class="derecha">
    Of my favorite movies, I only have 4 too marked which are Sucker Punch, which is very well developed. 
    Another is V for Vendetta which is based on the comic with the same name, it's a story that leaves you thinking about 
    as the government has us under control. Finally there are Angels and Demons which is also based on a novel with the 
    same title, is the prequel to "The Da Vinci Code" and is a great adventure of mystery with symbolisms.

    <h1>Favorite programs</h1>
    <p class="izquierda">
        I 'm not a person who watches a lot of series, I'm actually more than watching anime but I can mention a series that really 
        you could see again that they are "Queen's Gambit" which is about a young prodigy in the chess world. Another series is "Malcolm
        the Middle" which deals with the life of Malcolm, a boy genius who lives with his family and in the series shows us the
        experience of him and his family since each chapter shows us how they live being a poor family. Finally, I had to 
        mention an anime and the one I will mention is "Hunter x Hunter" is an adventure anime and go that develops an incredible adventure.
